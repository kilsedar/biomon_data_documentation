    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "The circular material use rate$^{1}$, also called Circularity rate, measures the share of material recovered and fed back into the economy - thus saving extraction of primary raw materials - in overall material use. It is defined as the ratio of the circular use of materials (U) to the overall material use (M), in percentage. \n",
    "\n",
    "A higher circularity rate value indicates that more secondary materials substitute for primary raw materials thus reducing the environmental impacts of extracting primary material. \n",
    "\n",
    "### More infomation\n",
    "\n",
    "* The overall material use (M) \n",
    "\n",
    "    M is measured by summing up the aggregate domestic material consumption (DMC) and the circular use of materials (U) ($M = DMC + U$)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "* Domestic material Consumption \n",
    "\n",
    "    DMC is an indicator derived from economy-wide material flow accounts (EW-MFA) collected under [Regulation (EU) 691/2011](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:02011R0691-20140616). DMC represents the overall amount of primary raw materials used by an economy. It equals domestic extraction plus imports minus exports.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "* The circular use of materials (U) \n",
    "\n",
    "    U is approximated by the amount of waste recycled in domestic recovery plants ($RCV_{R}$), minus imported waste destined for recovery ($IMP_{w}$), plus exported waste destined for recovery abroad ($EXP_{w}$) ($U = RCV_{R} - IMP_{w} + EXP_{w}$)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Waste recycled in domestic recovery plants is approximated by the amount of hazardous and non-hazardous waste treated in recovery plants excluding amounts used for energy recovery and backfilling (recovery operations R2 to R11 as defined in the Waste Framework Directive [75/442/EEC](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1504263102941&uri=CELEX:31975L0442)). This amount of treated waste is corrected by imports and exports of waste. \n",
